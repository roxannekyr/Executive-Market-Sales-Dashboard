<h1>Executive Market Sales Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
🛒 Retail Sales & Returns Analysis
A business intelligence solution built for a global retailer to track KPIs and regional performance. This project demonstrates end-to-end Power BI development, from data modeling to visualization.

Technical Highlights:<br />
Advanced DAX Measures: Implemented complex measures for Month-over-Month (MoM) growth calculations, profit margins, and conditional formatting rules.<br />
Data Modeling: Built a star schema connecting transaction tables with dimension tables (Calendar, Customers, Products, Regions).<br />
Conditional Formatting: Applied heat maps to the "Top 30 Brands" table to instantly highlight high profit margins (green) and high return rates (red).<br />
Dynamic Filtering: Integrated slicers for geography (USA, Canada, Mexico) to allow users to filter the entire report context.<br />
Visuals: Utilized Matrix tables, KPI cards, Map visuals, Bar charts, and Gauge charts.<br />
