<h1>Executive Market Sales Dashboard</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Technical Highlights:<br />

Advanced DAX Measures: Implemented complex measures for Month-over-Month (MoM) growth calculations, profit margins, and conditional formatting rules.

Data Modeling: Built a star schema connecting transaction tables with dimension tables (Calendar, Customers, Products, Regions).

Conditional Formatting: Applied heat maps to the "Top 30 Brands" table to instantly highlight high profit margins (green) and high return rates (red).

Dynamic Filtering: Integrated slicers for geography (USA, Canada, Mexico) to allow users to filter the entire report context.

Visuals: Utilized Matrix tables, KPI cards, Map visuals, Bar charts, and Gauge charts.
